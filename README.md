# My-Portfolio
The "My-Portfolio" website is a personal portfolio project designed to showcase my work, skills, and accomplishments as a Django Backend Developer. Built with the Django framework, the website features a user-friendly interface developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with SQLite as the backend database for content management and storage.
